# Google_Speech_Recognition
Implementation of retreiving sound from a microphone and fetching the Speech To Text using Google Clous API.
All implementations currently only use Synchronous recognition which implies a maximum length of audio files of 1 minute.

Each named folder contains different code implementations (such as C#, Python, ...).

Note that each implementation require a API - key from Google.
