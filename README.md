# Google Speech Recognition
Implementation of retreiving sound from a microphone and fetching the Speech To Text using Google Clouds API.
The ```Python``` implementation allows for "unlimited" length of recordings but the recommended length is still < 1 minute per recording.

Each named folder contains different code implementations (such as C#, Python, ...).

Note that each implementation require an API - key from Google.

## C#
* [x] Add Asynconous recognition.
* [ ] Add recognition outside of forms.

## Python
