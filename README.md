# Google Speech Recognition
Implementation of retreiving sound from a microphone and fetching the Speech To Text using Google Clouds API.
The ```Python``` implementation allows for "unlimited" length of recordings, this is however not currently tested and the recommended length is < 1 minute per recording.

Each named folder contains different code implementations (such as C#, Python, ...).

Note that each implementation require an API - key from Google.
